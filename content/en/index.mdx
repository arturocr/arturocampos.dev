I'm a Solutions Architect and Web Practice Lead at [Gorilla Logic](https://gorillalogic.com) 🦍 , currently living in Costa Rica 🇨🇷

JavaScript is my passion, enjoying it a little bit more every single day for the last 12 years 💪

I'm also the proud father of Sol 🩰 and Nico 🎮, and the happy husband of Marisol 🎨

I enjoy shredding some trails and roads with my hard-tail mountain bike 🚵
