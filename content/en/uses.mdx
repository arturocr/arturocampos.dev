description: A list of the software and hardware that I use as an engineer
---

This is a summary of the software/hardware setup that I use on a daily basis.

## Editor + Terminal

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), I used to be a loyal user on Sublime Text (I still use it as my default text editor) but things change, VSCode is so good.
- [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) is my terminal of choice.
- I'm constantly trying different themes and right now I'm using [Darcula](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dracula-theme.theme-dracula) in VSCode and [Shades of Purple](https://github.com/ahmadawais/shades-of-purple-hyper) for Hyper.
- I use [Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/) as my default editor font.

## Desktop Apps

- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is my browser.
- I use [1Password](https://1password.com/) to protect my passwords.
- I keep track of my ToDos and project notes in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/).
- [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) makes easier to track my freelance timesheets.
- When I need to design something I use [Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) or [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html). Sometimes [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) or [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).
- I have several Google and G Suite accounts, so to centralize the use of them I use [Kiwi for Gmail](https://www.kiwiforgmail.com/). However, I'm currently trying [Mimestream](https://mimestream.com/).
